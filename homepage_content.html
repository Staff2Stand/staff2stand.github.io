    <h1>Music First, Notation Later</h1>
    <p>Beginning musicians are often limited by how well they can read standard music notation. A few simple digital tools allow students to focus on how to <i>create</i> the music, rather than on how to <i>read</i> the music. Following the popular analogy, we must learn to speak before we learn to read.</p>

    <h1>Culturally Responsive Music</h1>
    <p>All music has been carefully selected to ensure a certain standard of cultural responsiveness.</p>

    <p><i>Cultural responsiveness</i> in music refers to recognizing, respecting, and embracing the diversity of musical traditions, practices, and expressions from different cultures. It involves being aware of and sensitive to the cultural contexts and meanings behind music, as well as actively engaging with and appreciating music from various cultural backgrounds.</p>
